The goal ist to collect data of PM10 and PM2.5 partikular matter on thousands of stations around the world, to have control of the air quality in your area.
Most of the measurements you find in europe.

Additional to that, it would be nice to have a low cost handheld particle-counter to make mesurements wherever you want. Here you find the solution: a low-cost-particle-counter-based-on-SDS011 and arduino UNO.

To display the values we use a NEXTION Display, its easy to use and powerful in what you can show.
